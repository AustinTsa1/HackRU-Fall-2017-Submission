# Re-Call
Whether it's a conference call or a phone interview, you never have to forget your important conversations again! If you've ever wondered how you've sounded when talking to people over the phone, you need not wonder any more. ReCall will allow you to record all your important conversations and improve upon your speaking abilities in hindsight. This project utilizes Twilio's API, Javascript, Node.JS, Bootstrap, and Mlab (MongoDB). It will record conversations and store it in a database for future reference. In order to access the recordings, you will need to log into a website that is secured through a complex encryption algorithm. You can go over your past recordings and transcription notes will allow you to get a general understanding of the conversation.
